<h3>What is the python</h3>
Python is a high-level, general- purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.

<h4>High Level</h4>
A high-level programming language is designed to be easy for humans to read and write,
while also being easily translated into machine code for computers to execute. High-level
programming languages are typically more abstract and closer to natural language than
low-level programming languages, which are more similar to the binary code that
computers understand. Examples of high-level programming languages include Python,
Java, and Ruby.

<h4>General purpose</h4>
A general-purpose programming language does not focus on specific niche or usage of
programming, but instead provides a toolbox, libraries and built-in functions for different
demands - limited only by programmer's creativity. Examples of general-purpose
languages are Python, C++, Ruby, Java etc. In opposition specific-purpose languages are
created and optimized for specific usage - like HTML and CSS for websites' creation or
Swift for IOS apps.

<h4>Dynamically-typed</h4>
A dynamically-typed language is a programming language where the data type of a
variable is determined at runtime, rather than being explicitly defined in the code. This
means that variables can be assigned different data types during the execution of the
program. Examples of dynamically-typed languages include Python, Ruby, and
JavaScript.

<h4>Garbage-collected</h4>
A garbage-collected programming language is a type of programming language in which
the language runtime automatically manages memory allocation and deallocation. This
means that the programmer does not need to explicitly allocate and deallocate memory,
as the runtime system automatically keeps track of which blocks of memory are no
longer being used and frees them up for reuse. This can simplify programming and
reduce the risk of memory leaks and other memory-related errors. However, garbage
collection can also introduce overhead and may affect program performance in some
cases.

<h3>The creation of Python</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Python was created by Guido van Rossum
in 1991.</li>
<li>He started working on it in late 1989, but the idea
began even earlier</li>
  <li>Guido was named Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL) by
the Computer Science community as the first person in the
world, which means he was the ultimate instance of
authority when it comes to disputes about Python</li>
